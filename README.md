SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
üéØ Purpose
To simulate realistic selection scenarios (e.g., job interviews, college admissions, award applications).

To help selectors (recruiters, admission officers) test their decision-making.

To help applicants (job seekers, students) improve their application strategy.

üë• User Roles
Applicants

Create and submit simulated resumes/CVs, applications, essays, etc.

Practice interviews or application questions.

Receive feedback on performance.

Selectors

Review simulated applicants using customizable criteria.

Make decisions under constraints (e.g., limited spots, diversity goals).

See analytics on their selection patterns (bias detection, etc.).

‚öôÔ∏è Core Features
Scenario Builder: Users create or choose pre-built scenarios (e.g., tech job, MBA program, art grant).

Role Switch: Users can toggle between being an applicant or a selector.

Application Materials Generator: Use AI to auto-generate sample applicants or let users create them manually.

Selection Dashboard: For selectors to view applications, rate them, compare, and select.

Feedback & Analytics: Reports on selection bias, time spent, decision quality.

Leaderboard/Scoring: Gamified environment for learning and competition.

üí° Use Cases
Recruiter Training: Teach recruiters to identify strong candidates fairly and efficiently.

Candidate Prep: Help students/job seekers understand what selectors look for.

Research & Academic Use: Study human decision-making under realistic conditions.

HR Consulting Firms: Use it to train clients on bias reduction and hiring effectiveness.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack Ideas
Frontend: React / Vue

Backend: Node.js / Django / Flask

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

AI Features: ChatGPT API for feedback, resume generation, and mock interview interaction

Hosting: AWS / Heroku / Vercel

## Technology Stack

 1. AI/ML Components (Optional but powerful)
 Tools & APIs:
OpenAI API (ChatGPT, DALL¬∑E) ‚Äì For generating feedback, interview questions, resumes, or essays

scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch ‚Äì If you're adding ML-driven ranking or decision modeling

Hugging Face Transformers ‚Äì For NLP tasks (e.g., applicant scoring, bias detection)

2. Database
 Tech:
PostgreSQL (relational, great for structured applicant-selector data)

MongoDB (if you want more flexible, document-based storage)

Optional: Redis (caching, session storage)
